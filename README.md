This is my repository for my semester long web developement project.

The task at hand is to create a functioning website that contains:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - PHP
    - SQL

The final web application will need to be interactive, as containing a student quiz, contact fill in form.
Log in page, and create account page. Other features specified in future requirement PDFs.
